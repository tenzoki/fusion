/**
 * Bash file-mutation guard — deterministic classifier for the PreToolUse hook.
 *
 * The guard's protected-path check is reachable only from the four write tools
 * (`Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `NotebookEdit`). A shell is a write tool too:
 * `mv rules/x.md /tmp/` moves a protected file with no tool the guard inspects.
 * This module is the missing half — it classifies a `Bash` command string
 * against the same `protectedPaths` list the write path uses.
 *
 * It is the sibling of `git-branch-guard.ts`, not a second parser: both consume
 * `shell-parse.ts`, this one in `"capture"` mode so a single-quoted operand
 * (`mv 'rules/x.md' /tmp/`) is read as the ordinary path it is.
 *
 * ## What counts as a mutation
 *
 * Recognition is TABLE-DRIVEN (`MUTATION_VERBS` below). One row per command,
 * naming which flags consume a value and which positional operands the command
 * WRITES. The written/read distinction is the point: `cp rules/x.md /tmp/y`
 * only READS the protected path and stays allowed, while `cp /tmp/y
 * rules/x.md` writes it and denies. Adding a verb later is a row and two tests,
 * not a new code path.
 *
 * WHICH WORD NAMES THE PROGRAM is not decided here. `command-word.ts` answers
 * that for both Bash classifiers: it skips a leading `VAR=value` assignment, a
 * shell grammar word (`if`, `while`, `{`, `!`, …) and any WRAPPER program that
 * runs another program, so `sudo rm rules/x.md`, `sudo env rm rules/x.md` and
 * `if rm rules/x.md; then …` all classify as the `rm` they are. Each wrapper's
 * own flags — and, for `timeout`, its duration operand — are consumed by the
 * wrapper's row, so the skip never assumes the second word is the verb.
 *
 * Output redirection (`>`, `>>`, `>|`, `N>`, glued or separated) is scanned
 * separately and position-independently, because a redirection binds to the
 * whole simple command wherever it appears — `>` makes ANY program a mutation.
 * An operator inside a double-quoted span is not one: bash redirects nothing
 * there, and `shell-parse`'s capture mode hands such a span over as an opaque
 * placeholder so a commit message about `rules/a.md -> rules/b.md` is prose.
 *
 * ## Ancestors count
 *
 * An operand that is not itself protected still denies when it is an ANCESTOR
 * DIRECTORY of a protected path: `rm -rf hooks` destroys `hooks/config.json`,
 * `mv hooks /tmp` relocates it out from under the guard. Each protected
 * pattern's glob-free leading segments are its literal prefix, and an operand
 * that is a proper directory prefix of one denies (`isAncestorOfProtected`).
 * The consequence is deliberate and was accepted at the plan's Q3 gate:
 * `rm -rf hooks`, `rm -rf fusion-workbench` and `mv hooks /tmp` deny, while
 * `rm -rf node_modules` and `rm -rf dist` do not. The check is uniform across
 * written operands rather than special-cased to destructive verbs, so a
 * destination directory is covered too — `cp /tmp/config.json hooks/` cannot
 * overwrite a protected file through a directory the classifier never inspects.
 * The project root itself is NOT treated as an ancestor: `cp x .` writes into
 * the root without destroying it, and denying it would catch ordinary work.
 *
 * ## Where a relative operand resolves from
 *
 * `cd fusion-workbench && rm -rf .guard-state` writes a protected path while
 * naming none, so the classifier carries a VIRTUAL WORKING DIRECTORY across a
 * compound command's segments (`walkVirtualCwd` below) and resolves every
 * relative operand against it. `cd`, `chdir`, `pushd` and `popd` move it; a
 * `cd` whose target is only known at run time makes it UNKNOWN, and a relative
 * operand under an unknown directory is unresolved and therefore denied, for
 * the same reason `mv $SRC rules/` is. Walking OUT of the project (`cd /tmp`,
 * `cd ../..`, `cd ~`) is tracked as faithfully as walking in, so a mutation out
 * there matches no relative pattern and stays allowed.
 *
 * The tracking is scoped: a `cd` inside a `(…)` subshell or a `$(…)` body is
 * discarded when it closes, exactly as bash discards it.
 *
 * ## Fail-closed, and its bound
 *
 * A shell can build a path at run time. When an operand of a RECOGNISED verb
 * cannot be resolved to a literal (it still carries `$`, a backtick, or a
 * leading `~`), the classifier DENIES rather than guessing — the same
 * discipline `classifyGitCommand` applies to a bare `git checkout`. An
 * UNRECOGNISED program is allowed however unparseable its arguments are, so
 * ordinary shell work is untouched.
 *
 * The bound holds for a REDIRECTION TARGET too, which is the one place it used
 * to leak: `npm test > "$LOG"` and `cat report.md > ~/backup.md` are ordinary
 * per-session idioms, and denying them was stricter than the table's own
 * baseline, which allows `curl -o rules/x.md` — a literal protected path with
 * an unrecognised program. A redirect target that RESOLVES is still checked
 * whatever the program is (`sort /tmp/a > rules/x.md` denies); it is only the
 * fail-closed pass that stops at the table's edge.
 *
 * ## The accepted residual (documented, not hidden)
 *
 * An unrecognised program that writes a protected path still writes it
 * (`curl -o rules/x.md …`, a project's own build script). A path constructed at
 * run time is denied when it is an operand of a recognised verb and invisible
 * otherwise. This check raises the cost of the bypass from zero to deliberate;
 * it does not eliminate it, and no claim that `protectedPaths` is enforced
 * should be made without that qualification.
 *
 * The wrapper list is the same kind of bound, and it is stated where the list
 * lives (`command-word.ts`): a program that runs another program and is not a
 * row still hides the verb underneath it (`parallel rm rules/x.md`), and a
 * program that takes its command as a STRING bash re-parses (`eval`,
 * `bash -c`) is outside the mechanism entirely.
 *
 * Shell grammar the word-level resolver cannot name is the third bound. A
 * `case` arm and a function definition both put an ordinary-looking word in
 * command position (`build) rm rules/x.md;;`, `f() { rm rules/x.md; }`) that no
 * table can distinguish from a program, so the verb behind it is not reached.
 *
 * A whole-tree operand that is not a path is invisible for the same reason a
 * glob is matched literally: `rm -rf *` names no directory the ancestor check
 * can compare, so it is not caught. (`rm -rf .` IS caught once a `cd` has moved
 * the virtual working directory somewhere protected — see the ancestor note
 * above — and is not at the project root, where `rm` refuses it anyway.)
 *
 * A `#` COMMENT is not stripped, in either direction: the lexer has no notion
 * of one, so `ls -la # writes > rules/x.md` is scanned as code and denies on
 * the redirect its comment only describes, while `rm rules/x.md # noop` is
 * denied for the right reason and `echo hi # && rm rules/x.md` is denied for
 * the wrong one. Stripping comments is a change to the lexer that blank mode
 * (pinned byte-for-byte against the legacy segmenter) cannot take, so it stays
 * a stated residual rather than half a fix. It errs toward DENY.
 *
 * Two sibling `$(…)` substitutions inside ONE outer segment share a virtual
 * working directory, because `shell-parse` reports a depth but not a subshell
 * identity: `$(cd /tmp) $(rm rules/x.md)` therefore resolves the second body
 * from `/tmp` and allows. It is contrived enough to be a residual rather than a
 * defect; anything an agent actually writes puts the two in separate segments,
 * where they are correctly independent.
 *
 * This module is PURE and EXPORTED so it is unit-testable without the hook
 * firing. It never touches the filesystem, the environment, or the process:
 * the protected list, the project-relative normaliser and the exemption
 * predicate all arrive through `MutationOptions`.

/**
 * THE VERB TABLE. Exported because it is the review surface: a false positive

 *   in-place rewrite    — sed -i, perl -i, truncate, tee, dd
 *   (redirection is scanned separately; see `scanSegment`)
 *
 * `sed` and `perl` take ALL positionals rather than modelling where the script
 * ends, because the two platforms disagree about `-i` and a sed script never
 * matches a protected-path glob. `sed -i '' 's/MUST/may/' rules/x.md` therefore
 * denies on `rules/x.md` and `sed -i '' 's/a/b/' notes.txt` allows, on both
 * platforms, with no platform branch in the code.
 *
 * Two things widen a row's reach beyond the literal command it names, and both
 * are reviewed with the table rather than apart from it:
 *
 *   - A row is reached THROUGH a wrapper (`WRAPPER_PROGRAMS` in
 *     `command-word.ts`) or a grammar word. `sudo rm …`, `if rm …; then`,
 *     `xargs rm …` and `sudo env rm …` are the `rm` row.
 *   - A written operand matches by ANCESTRY as well as by pattern
 *     (`ancestorOfProtected`). `rm -rf hooks` is the `rm` row hitting
 *     `hooks/config.json` without naming it.
 *
 * Neither is per-verb, so a new row inherits both. Adding a verb whose operands
 * are usually directories is therefore a wider change than adding one that
 * names files, and `mkdir`, `chmod`, `chown`, `touch`, `rsync`, `patch`, `tar`
 * and `gzip` are deliberately NOT rows.

 *
 * `mv` and `rm` are the unconditional rows. The other three write the working
 * tree only under a flag, and the flag is what separates them from the form
 * fusion depends on:
 *
 *   - `clean` mutates with `-f`, refuses without it, so `git clean -n rules`
 *     (a dry run, a read) allows and `git clean -fdx rules` denies. `-e` takes
 *     the exclude PATTERN as its value and must not become a positional, or
 *     `git clean -fdx -e rules/keep .` would deny on the pattern it is told to
 *     spare.
 *   - `restore` bare is `git checkout -- <paths>` under its modern name —
 *     fusion's own revert strategy, which MUST stay allowed, as must
 *     `git restore --staged <paths>`, which writes only the index. With
 *     `--source=<commit>` it overwrites the working tree from anywhere in
 *     history, which the revert strategy's permission does not cover.
 *   - `stash push <paths>` REMOVES the named paths from the working tree. The
 *     row reads every positional, so the subcommand word of `git stash pop` and
 *     friends lands in the written set as the literal `pop` — a path that
 *     matches nothing, which is why one row covers the whole family without a
 *     sub-sub-command table.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT here: `git apply` and `git am`, whose targets are
 * named inside the patch file rather than on the command line. Reading a patch
 * is out of scope for a text classifier, so they sit in the residual list next
 * to `patch`. A bare `git clean -fdx` with no path operand is the same kind of
 * residual — it names no directory the ancestor check can compare, exactly as
