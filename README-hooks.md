# Compliance Guard — Claude Code Hook System

The Compliance Guard intercepts agent tool calls in real time, blocking writes to protected paths and escalating changes to decision-governed areas. It is the `.claude` agent system's equivalent of Fusion's Decision Guard.

## Concept

When Claude Code executes a Write, Edit, MultiEdit, or NotebookEdit tool call, the hook system runs *before* the write happens. The guard checks the target file path against three layers of rules:

1. **Halt check** — if the guard has been halted (after repeated violations), *all* writes are blocked until a human clears it
2. **Protected paths** — files that agents must never modify directly (agent definitions, rules, workbench state)
3. **Decision-governed categories** — files governed by project decisions, with configurable sensitivity levels

If a check fails, the tool call is denied and the agent receives the reason — including which decision(s) the write would violate. This gives the agent explicit feedback about *why* it was blocked, not just that it was.

### Escalation

Consecutive blocks accumulate. After a configurable threshold (default: 3), the guard enters **halt mode** — blocking all write operations until a human reviews the situation and clears the halt. This catches the pattern where an agent repeatedly attempts a disallowed action.

### Churn Detection

A PostToolUse tracker records every file mutation. When the same file is changed too many times in a session (thrashing), the guard raises warnings and can escalate to the orchestrator.

## Architecture

```
Claude Code
  |
  +-- SessionStart
  |     \-- exports FUSION_PLUGIN_ROOT to $CLAUDE_ENV_FILE
  |
  +-- PreToolUse (Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit)
  |     \-- guard.ts
  |           +-- config.json (rules, paths, decisions, thresholds)
  |           +-- fusion-workbench/.guard-state/escalation.json (halt flag, block count)
  |           \-- fusion-workbench/.guard-state/events.jsonl (audit log)
  |
  +-- PostToolUse (Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit/Bash)
        \-- tracker.ts
              +-- fusion-workbench/.guard-state/churn.json (per-file change counts)
              \-- fusion-workbench/.guard-state/events.jsonl (audit log)
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Verify hooks are wired

The plugin wires hooks automatically via `hooks.json`. The hooks use pre-compiled JavaScript (`hooks/dist/`) invoked with plain `node` — no `npx tsx` needed, no `node_modules` at runtime.

The effective hook configuration:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "echo 'export FUSION_PLUGIN_ROOT=${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}' >> \"$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE\"" }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/dist/guard.js" }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit|Bash",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/dist/tracker.js" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Review the configuration

Edit `hooks/config.json` to define:

- **Protected paths** — which files are off-limits
- **Category paths** — which file areas map to which decision categories
- **Decisions** — the actual rules, each with an ID, category, statement, and optional rule file reference
- **Sensitivity** — how aggressively each category escalates (none/low/medium/high)
- **Thresholds** — when to escalate (blocks before halt, churn limits)

### 3. Start a Claude Code session

The hooks activate automatically on session start. No manual startup needed.

## Files

| File | Purpose | Committed? |
|------|---------|------------|
| `guard.ts` | PreToolUse hook — checks and blocks writes | Yes |
| `tracker.ts` | PostToolUse hook — records changes, detects churn | Yes |
| `clear-halt.ts` | Manual halt reset utility | Yes |
| `config.json` | Guard rules, decisions, thresholds | Yes |
| `lib/paths.ts` | Glob-to-regex path matching | Yes |
| `lib/config.ts` | JSON config loader | Yes |
| `lib/escalation.ts` | Escalation state management | Yes |
| `lib/events.ts` | Append-only event logger | Yes |
| `lib/churn.ts` | Churn heatmap tracker | Yes |
| `package.json` | Dev dependencies (tsx, typescript, vitest) | Yes |

## Usage

### Clearing a halt

When the guard halts, all writes are blocked. To clear:

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/dist/clear-halt.js
```

Or from within a Claude Code session, the orchestrator can invoke this at a human gate.

### Adding a decision

Edit `config.json` and add an entry under `decisions`:

```json
{
  "decisions": [
    {
      "id": "my-rule-001",
      "category": "my-category",
      "statement": "Description of what this rule protects and why",
      "ruleFile": "rules/relevant-file.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then ensure `my-category` is mapped in `categoryPaths`:

```json
{
  "guard": {
    "categoryPaths": {
      "my-category": ["path/to/protected/files/**"]
    },
    "categorySensitivity": {
      "my-category": "medium"
    }
  }
}
```

### Viewing the event log

```bash
cat fusion-workbench/.guard-state/events.jsonl | jq .
```

Or tail it in a second terminal during a session:

```bash
tail -f fusion-workbench/.guard-state/events.jsonl | jq .
```

### Running tests

```bash
cd hooks && npm install && npx vitest run
```

### Rebuilding after TS changes

```bash
cd hooks && npm install && npm run build
```

The compiled `hooks/dist/` directory is committed to the repo and ships with the plugin.

## Origin

Ported from Fusion's guard system (`fusion/reactor/pkg/guard/`):
- `decision_guard.go` → `guard.ts` + `lib/config.ts` + `lib/paths.ts`
- `escalation.go` → `lib/escalation.ts`
- `churn_heatmap.go` → `lib/churn.ts`
- `event_parser.go` → `lib/events.ts`

The key difference: Fusion intercepts via the SDK's `canUseTool` callback in a running Go server. The Compliance Guard intercepts via Claude Code's native hook system — external scripts invoked per tool call.
